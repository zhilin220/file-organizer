# File Organizer

A simple Windows utility (no installation required) to organize files in a folder by type.  
This tool scans a folder and moves files into categorized subfolders such as **Images**, **Documents**, **Videos**, **Audio**, **Programming**, **Applications**, and more.

This repository also includes a pre-built executable that you can download without installing Python.

## 🛠️ How It Works

This program uses Python’s `os` and `shutil` modules to scan folders and move files into categorized subfolders based on file extensions.

The organization happens recursively, but it avoids going into existing destination folders to prevent infinite loops.

## ⚠️ Notes & Tips

- Recommended for personal or work folders (e.g., messy Downloads, Documents)
- Always try it first on a **test folder** to see how it behaves
- If your organization needs change (e.g., new file types), you can update the category lists in the source code
